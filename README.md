Study of national survey data on Americans' opinions on abortion

Read about and download the data here: https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/nationscape-data-set 

This repository contains code that I used to explore how Americains perceive abortion. Given how media and personalized content based on relevance (i.e. Facebook) 
have a well-documented tendency to bias what we read, it seemed useful and important to take a more objective look at the position of the country as a whole on an 
issue as divisive as abortion.
